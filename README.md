## Description

This library can be used to create a DropCap in your app! A DropCap is the first letter of a paragraph that's of a much
bigger size than the rest that follow. The formatting is such that the DropCap spans (drops down) to cover the few lines
following the first.

## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.novoda:drop-cap:<latest-version>'
}
```

## Simple usage

Simply add `DropCapView` to one of your layout xml files and use the following xml attributes for customization.

```
  <attr name="lineSpacingExtra" format="dimension" />
  <attr name="dropCapTextSize" format="dimension" />
  <attr name="dropCapTextColor" format="color" />
  <attr name="dropCapFontPath" format="string" />

  <attr name="copyTextSize" format="dimension" />
  <attr name="copyTextColor" format="color" />
  <attr name="copyFontPath" format="string" />
```
